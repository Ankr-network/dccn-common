# dccn-common cert manager test
The 6 files were generated by the following function in ..\cert_test.go

```
func TestGenerateRSAServerAndClientCert(t *testing.T)
```

- you generate your own cert/key files or use these pre-generated files for testing.
- ca.pem file is not being used here. The other 5 files are being used in below commands.

## server side

```
$ openssl s_server -accept 8888 -cert server.crt -CAfile ca.crt -key server-key.pem -Verify 2 -www
```

## client side

```
$ openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:8888 -CAfile ca.crt -cert client.crt -key client-key.pem
```

After the mutual authentication, you can issue 'GET /' to finish the connection.
